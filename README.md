# J.E.R.V.I.S
J.E.R.V.I.S - Java Enabled Robot Virtual Intelligence System The aim of this project is to build Virtual Intelligence Assistant. J.E.R.V.I.S will take user’s commands, analyse them and provide a relevant response. The main features of the optimal solution will consist of: Graphical User Interface (GUI), task organiser - remembering and reminding you of birthdays, appointments, physical addresses, email addresses, weather forecast, local file system explorer, retrieving information from the internet as well as conducting small informal conversations. Every feature will be enabled using voice recognition. Nevertheless, GUI interface will be provided. The whole task is divided into 3 stages. Stage one consists in developing a Java GUI application that recognises human voice and reads it back to the user. Stage 2 is to produce a initial Machine Learning Algorithm that will define J.E.R.V.I.S’s way of thinking. Stage 3 involves implementation of J.E.R.V.I.S’s features.
