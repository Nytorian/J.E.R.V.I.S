J.E.R.V.I.S - Java Enabled Robot Virtual Intelligent System. The aim of this project is to build Virtual Intelligent Assistant. J.E.R.V.I.S will take user’s commands, analyse them and provide a relevant response. The main features of the optimal solution will consist of Graphical User Interface (GUI) and life organiser - remembering and reminding various events such as birthdays and appointments. Furthermore, J.E.R.V.I.S will be able to remember and retrieve email addresses, provide weather forecast and browse through local file system.
For innovation purposes, J.E.R.V.I.S will be able to conduct a short dialog with its users. The project is divided into 3 stages. Stage one consists in developing a Java GUI application with Speech Recognition engine that recognises human voice and reads it back to the user. Stage 2 is to implement Machine Learning Algorithm that will define J.E.R.V.I.S’s way of thinking. Stage 3 involves implementation of J.E.R.V.I.S’s assistant features.
